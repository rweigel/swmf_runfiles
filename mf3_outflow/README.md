# MF3 Outflow Sensitivity Study

These input files are for running a sensitivity study on
"defacto"-type outflow (e.g., *Welling and Liemohn 2014*).
It uses the 3-fluid approach: $H^{+}_{sw}$, $H^{+}_{iono}$,
and $O^{+}_{iono}$. The inner boundary conditions and upstream
solar conditions are varied to investigate the sensitivity to
these factors of outflow fluence and magnetospheric composition.
